Web Development Practice Repository

Welcome to my Web Development Practice Repository! As I embark on my journey of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the first time, this repository serves as a space to document my progress and practice my skills. Here, you'll find various projects, including a personal portfolio and a responsive webpage. Each project is an opportunity for me to enhance my understanding of web development concepts. Iâ€™m excited to learn and grow, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions!
